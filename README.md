Austin Nwandu has some couple of experience when it comes to IT.
Over the years, I have zeroed in on Data Science and analytics.
Data is part of life and as such should be given the utmost priority in decision-making. 
Gathering, cleaning & analyzing data using tools like Power BI, Tableau, and MySQL just to mention a few provides information that leads to knowledge and wisdom for actionable intelligence.
I am your sure plug to achieving this.
